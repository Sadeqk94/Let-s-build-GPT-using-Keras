# Let-s-build-GPT-using-Keras
TF/Keras implementation GPT

There is an excellent video by [Andrej
Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/) titled ["Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled
out."](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY?si=_l3tBiaZgq1NXwWW). In the video, Karpathy provides
a detailed, step-by-step guide to building a GPT model using PyTorch.

In this notebook, I present a TensorFlow/Keras version of Karpathy's implementation. This
notebook follows the same principles and steps outlined in the video, allowing you to
gain the same understanding and insights using TensorFlow/Keras. You can follow along
with the video and refer to this notebook for the equivalent TensorFlow/Keras code,
making it a valuable resource for anyone familiar with TensorFlow or looking to learn it.

You can run it on Colab:
